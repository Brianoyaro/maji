Introduction
Maji app acts as a bridge between those who are in need of water to those who sell water. Most places in Africa suffer from water shortages, instead of searching through the internet for contacts of water vendors and/or potential customers, why not use Maji app instead? 

Features
1) Secure messaging
Maji incorpiorates a secure messaging feature where only parties of interest [intended recipients] see the particular message. With this feature, a vendor and customer may communicate securely amongst themselves. A customer may also proide feedback to the vendor on how to improve their services which in turn improves service delivery.

2) Easy to use ordering scheme
Customers can order easily just by the tap of a button, they have the option of sifting through available vendors to find those closest to them.

3) Nice UI
Vendors have a nice UI where they get to see pending orders. After fulfilling an order, they have the option of marking it as fulfilled which in turn removes the message from pending messages queue list.

4) Notifications
Vendors are notified immediately an order is placed through e-mail which iproves round time for service delivery.
